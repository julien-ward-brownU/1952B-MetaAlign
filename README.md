# 1952B-MetaAlign README

## Overview

This is a final project for 1952B: Responsible Computer Science in Practice. For design discussion see
the project writeup pdf as well as ctrl+F #ANNOTATION in the code. 

## How to use:

This is very much a prototype. If you would like to use this in its current state, search TORUN, and 
insert the name of your image as well as which preferences defined in main to use, which you can
customize. You will have to put the image in the input folder as well. Some functionality is pseudocode
and does not work as intended. This is built off of functionality from the Exif Tool by Phil Harvey, 
the version of the tool provided is the windows one, you must download the mac version to run it on mac.
